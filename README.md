![VirtualDice](https://github.com/pizzawizard32/VirtualDice/blob/main/virtualdice.png?raw=true)

A simple program for rolling dices that uses a similiar layout to neofetch.

## Supported OSes
- Windows NT (tested on Windows 2000 and higher, lmk if it works on older Windows)

**Future support for:**
- Linux
- Haiku
- Nintendo 3DS
- FreeBSD
- more

## Compilation
This is a tutorial of how to compile the program as I found out myself that the already compiled program on Windows 2000 is broken:
- `git clone` the source code:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/pizzawizard32/VirtualDice
  ```
- Compile `main.cc` with MinGW, install it if you haven't.
  ```sh
  g++ main.cc
  ```
